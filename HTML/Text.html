                            Romance scam, Tech support scam, Emergency scams, charity scam, etc, these are all made to take your private information or money. 
                            Romance scam is a scam that works by tricking someone that they have met the love of their life before asking for some money. 
                            The tech support scam works by telling the victim that they have for example a virus on their computer, and they need some information to fix it. 
                            Old people are most vulnerable here because they have little knowledge about online security. 
                            Emergency scam works by playing a hurt family member that needs money to get home. 
                            Young people are easy to fool here because they care about their older ones and get stressed easily. 
                            Charity scams make you think that you have won or inherited loads of money, and you need to pay for shipping. You pay and never receive anything.                </h4>

                            The internet is evolving, and we see new ways of Online Scamming all the time. 
                            The one that has had the biggest impact would be the Phishing scam. 
                            It works by informing the victim that they are a trusted organization or person, then precedes to ask for private details like their bank info. 
                            The word “Phishing” has received its name by the word fishing. 
                            When you go fishing you put a bait on the hook and wait for some innocent fish to take it. 
                            This is how the scam works.

                            How to avoid
                        </h3>

                            Studies show that the targeted groups of people are young people, people with disabilities, and those who are 60+. 
                            This is because they are easier to fool. 
                            Young people do not have the experience, neither do old people. 
                            Some people are just trusting people, and this makes them easy to trick. 
                            When online, you must be a critic to what is real and what could possibly be a scam. 
                            It is important to learn about the different scams in order to avoid them. 
                            The scams aren’t just found in emails, they are everywhere.
                            There are many documentaries that explain this. 
                            The Tinder Swindler is an example of someone that was tricked to believe that they met the love of their life on tinder, before lending them money. 
                            The victims ended up losing their money. 
                            The chances of meeting the dream person online are close to 0. 
                            You can’t trust people you don’t know. 
                            My tips to you in order not to get scammed is to doublecheck if something seems off and always be a critic. 
                            Never give away your personal info to anyone unless if you are 100% certain that it is legit. 
                            It is easy to be on autopilot and forget to doublecheck who the sender is before doing something dumb.

                    <h4>
                        There are many scams out there and it is very important to be critical to weird information. 
                        Always doublecheck that you are on the right website, and that the sender is legit. 
                        People could create fake sites that look like the real ones. 
                        If you are not shure what to believe, ask someone you know or trust for advice. 
                        There are many organizations that could help you with your security, however they could also be scammers. 
                        Therefore, you never give away private information. 
                        After reading this text I hope you have a broader knowledge of how the typical online scam works and how you can avoid dangerous situations.
